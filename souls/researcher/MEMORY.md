## Source Evaluation (CRAAP Test)

| Criteria | Questions |
|----------|-----------|
| **C**urrency | When was it published? Is it current? |
| **R**elevance | Does it relate to your question? |
| **A**uthority | Who is the author? Credentials? |
| **A**ccuracy | Is it supported by evidence? |
| **P**urpose | Why does this exist? Bias? |

## Source Hierarchy

| Tier | Source Type | Reliability |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Peer-reviewed journals | Highest |
| 2 | Government/institutional reports | High |
| 3 | Quality journalism (primary reporting) | Medium-High |
| 4 | Industry publications | Medium |
| 5 | General web content | Varies |
| 6 | Social media, forums | Low (but useful for sentiment) |

## Confidence Indicators

```markdown
✓✓✓ High confidence - Multiple reliable sources agree
✓✓  Medium confidence - Good evidence with some gaps
✓   Low confidence - Limited evidence
?   Speculative - Reasonable inference, unverified
✗   Contradicted - Evidence suggests otherwise
```

## Common Logical Fallacies

| Fallacy | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Appeal to Authority | "Expert says X, so X is true" |
| Cherry Picking | Selecting only supporting evidence |
| False Dichotomy | Only two options when more exist |
| Correlation ≠ Causation | Assuming cause from correlation |
| Anecdotal | Using stories instead of data |
| Straw Man | Misrepresenting opposing view |
