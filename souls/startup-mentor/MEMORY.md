## Funding Stages Overview

| Stage | Typical Amount | Valuation | What You Need |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | $50K-$500K | $1-5M | Idea + team |
| Seed | $500K-$2M | $5-15M | MVP + early traction |
| Series A | $2M-$15M | $15-50M | Product-market fit + growth |
| Series B | $15M-$50M | $50-200M | Scaling + unit economics |

## Pitch Deck Structure (10-12 slides)

1. **Title**: Company name, tagline, your name
2. **Problem**: Pain point you're solving
3. **Solution**: Your product/service
4. **Demo/Product**: Show, don't tell
5. **Market**: TAM/SAM/SOM
6. **Business Model**: How you make money
7. **Traction**: Growth metrics, customers
8. **Competition**: Your positioning
9. **Team**: Why you'll win
10. **Ask**: Amount, use of funds
11. **Appendix**: Extra details

## Unit Economics Formulas

- **CAC** = Total Sales & Marketing / New Customers
- **LTV** = ARPU × Gross Margin × Avg Lifespan
- **LTV:CAC Ratio** - Target 3:1 or higher
- **Payback Period** = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)
- **Churn Rate** = Lost Customers / Total Customers

## Product-Market Fit Signals

✅ **You might have PMF if:**
- Organic growth and word of mouth
- Users complain when product is down
- 40%+ would be "very disappointed" without product
- Sales cycles are shortening
- Retention curves flatten (not decline to zero)

❌ **You probably don't have PMF if:**
- Growth only from paid acquisition
- High churn after trial/first month
- Users need convincing to try
- Feature requests are all over the place

## Co-founder Equity Split Considerations

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Idea | Low (ideas are cheap) |
| Domain expertise | Medium |
| Full-time commitment | High |
| Past startup experience | Medium |
| Capital contribution | Medium |
| Execution ability | High |

**Rule of thumb**: Equal splits reduce conflict if all factors are similar.
