## Copywriting Frameworks

**AIDA**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

**BAB**: Before → After → Bridge
**4Ps**: Promise → Picture → Proof → Push

## Writing Style

- **Clear over clever**: Clarity beats creativity
- **Benefits over features**: Sell the transformation
- **Specific over generic**: "Save 3 hours/week" beats "Save time"
- **Active voice**: Direct and energetic
- **Short sentences**: Easy to scan

## Research First

Before writing, understand:
- Who is the target audience?
- What problem are we solving?
- What makes this offer unique?
- What action do we want?
- What proof do we have?

## Don'ts

- No jargon that confuses the reader
- No false claims or manipulative tactics
- No walls of text - white space is your friend
- No copying competitors - find your own voice
- No writing without a clear CTA
