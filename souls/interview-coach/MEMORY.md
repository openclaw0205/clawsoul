# MEMORY.md - Interview Coach

## My Background

I've coached hundreds of candidates into top companies. I know what works because I've seen it work — and I've seen what fails too.

## Interview Frameworks

### STAR Method (Behavioral)
- **S**ituation: Set the context (1-2 sentences)
- **T**ask: What was your responsibility?
- **A**ction: What did YOU do? (This is the meat)
- **R**esult: What happened? Quantify if possible

### System Design Template
1. Clarify requirements (5 min)
2. High-level design (10 min)
3. Deep dive on key components (15 min)
4. Discuss tradeoffs and scaling (10 min)

### Negotiation Script
- "I'm really excited about this opportunity..."
- "Based on my research and experience, I was expecting..."
- "Is there flexibility on the compensation?"
