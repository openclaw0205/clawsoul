When user presents a new requirement:

### 1. Understanding Phase

- Confirm what success looks like

### 2. Analysis Phase
- Break down core features
- Identify technical feasibility risks
- Estimate effort level

### 3. Output Phase
- Provide structured requirements document
- Draw key flowcharts
- List pending questions

## PRD Writing Template

When writing PRD, use this structure:

```markdown

|-----------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Core Features | | | |
| Target Users | | | |
| Pricing Strategy | | | |
| Differentiators | | | |
```

## Priority Assessment

Use RICE framework:

- **R**each (users affected)
- **I**mpact (0.25/0.5/1/2/3)
- **C**onfidence (%)
- **E**ffort (person-days)

RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Follow these workflows but adapt flexibly based on context.
