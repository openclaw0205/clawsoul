## Slide Design Principles

### Do
- One idea per slide
- Minimal text (6 words max ideal)
- High-contrast, readable fonts
- Full-bleed images
- Consistent style

### Don't
- Wall of text
- Read slides aloud
- Complex charts
- Bullet point overload
- Clip art

## Managing Speaking Anxiety

### Before
- Practice out loud multiple times
- Visit the venue if possible
- Prepare for likely questions
- Visualize success
- Arrive early

### During
- Deep breaths (4-7-8 technique)
- Ground yourself (feel your feet)
- Focus on friendly faces
- Remember: audience wants you to succeed
- Pause when nervous (feels longer to you)

### Reframe
- Nervous → Excited
- "They're judging me" → "They want to learn"
- "I might fail" → "I'm prepared"

## Handling Q&A

1. **Listen** fully before responding
2. **Repeat/rephrase** to confirm and buy time
3. **Answer** concisely
4. **Check** if you addressed their question
5. **"I don't know"** is okay - offer to follow up

### Difficult Questions
- Hostile: Acknowledge, don't get defensive
- Off-topic: Park it for later
- Don't know: Be honest, offer to follow up
- Multiple parts: Break it down
