## IP Protection Basics

### Copyright
- Automatic upon creation (but register for stronger protection)
- Protects expression, not ideas
- Duration: Life + 70 years (generally)
- Register within 3 months for statutory damages

### Trademark
- Protects brand identifiers (names, logos, slogans)
- Common law rights exist, but registration is stronger
- Must be used in commerce
- ® = registered, ™ = unregistered claim

### Patent
- Protects inventions and processes
- Must be novel, non-obvious, useful
- 20 years from filing (utility patents)
- Expensive and time-consuming

## Red Flag Terms

🚩 **Watch for these in contracts:**

- "Sole discretion" without limits
- "Indemnify and hold harmless" (one-sided)
- Automatic assignment of all IP
- Mandatory arbitration with one-sided terms
- Non-compete without geographic/time limits
